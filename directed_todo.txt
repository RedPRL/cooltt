TODO:
+ add directed interval [DONE...?]
+ implement cofibrations for the directed interval
  - figure out if inequalities are sufficient for all filling algorithms [IN PROGRESS]
  - ...if not...figure out connections...
+ add directed/mixed extension types
  - ...but start first with just a hom type
+ add covariant filling problem
  - implement for relevant type formers
  - figure out â™­-modality for Pi domain
+ add UCov
  - implement universe lattice? 
+ add Segal/inner filling problem(s)
+ add UInner (i.e. USegal)
+ add FunGlue
+ figure out how to add cobar ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜–ðŸ˜­

Fun stuff to try (later):
+ manually add in some DHITs
+ add UCoCart
