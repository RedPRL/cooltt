# cooltt.vim

`cooltt` uses several Unicode characters in its concrete notation; each of these
can be typed easily in the Vim mode using the `digraph` feature; alternatively,
there are ASCII equivalents.

| Char | Digraph   | ASCII |
|------|-----------|-------|
| 𝕀    | `C-k II`  | `dim` |
| 𝔽    | `C-k FF`  | `cof` |
| ∧    | `C-k AN`  | `/\`  |
| ∨    | `C-k OR`  | `\/`  |
| λ    | `C-k *l`  | `\`   |
| ×    | `C-k *X`  | `*`   |
| →    | `C-k ->`  | `->`  |
